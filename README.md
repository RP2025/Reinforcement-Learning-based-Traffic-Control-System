# Reinforcement-Learning-based-Traffic-Control-System

Our project aims to implement the Self Organising Traffic Lights algorithm found in research paper - (https://arxiv.org/pdf/nlin/0610040v2.pdf) on different traffic simulations built on Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO). We are using the TraCI library (https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/TraCI.html) which will give us running access of traffic elements to implement said algorithm.
